@summary 

Concurrent usage of 1 scarce resource, moderated by a DLock.
 

Example 1: Real Multi-Processing. Verbose Logging. 

To show how DLock can lock across independent processes, 4 copies of this
script are spawned. They simultaneously write to stdout. The simple example:

4 sleepers are sharing 1 narrow bed, so always only 1 sleeper can sleep; 
the others must wait - or get impatient, and give up. 

There is a small probability that one sleeper forgets to unlock after use,
to demonstrate the lock TIMEOUT. There is limited PATIENCE also, so that
at least one of the sleepers will give up without ever acquiring the lock/bed.


Example 2: Massive hammering. Hundreds of consumers of 1 resource.

For simplicity, implemented multi-threading. Last test if DLock is safe.

n sleepers are started as threads, all wait for 1 bed, which is DLock'ed.
After one sleeper finishes, he notes the time. At the end, all these times
are compared, to show that there was never an overlap of sleepers.


For the inner workings of DLock, see the other example lockbydir.testDLock().
