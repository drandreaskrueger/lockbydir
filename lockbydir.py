@summary 

An easy to use lock mechanism, with lock timeout, and limited waiting patience.

I want locking of the django DB, across concurrent uwsgi processes, for any 
underlying DB. See posting: http://stackoverflow.com/q/28030536/3693375
When no one could really help me to the end, I created this class 'DLock'.

Inner workings:
A lock is represented by a lockdir, in the current directory (or a RAMDISK).

While it exists, and its filedate is recent, the lock is 'locked'.
If the dir does not exist, or is timed out, the lock is 'unlocked'.

Users need not care about the lockdir, but access the DLock class 
by two functions: .LoopWhileLocked_ThenLocking() and .unlocking()


Parameters:
TIMEOUT:  Seconds after which a lock opens automatically.
PATIENCE: Seconds after which no more hope to acquire the lock. 

Default TIMEOUT, and PATIENCE can be changed in each DLock instance, 
or (better) by subclassing DLock. 

Shortest possible usage is in howToUse().
The inner workings are well explained in testDLocks().
Parallel processes are shown in 2 examples in 'lockbydir_concurrent.py'. 


@todo: Possible future improvement:

TODO 1: how to make this atomic ?

    if self.timedOut():
       self.breakLock()  
       
I have never seen it happen (as the first step is very fast), but it is not 
impossible that 2 processes both arrive at .timedOut() = True at the same time. 
And when one has done '.breakLock()' AND later already created a new lock, 
only then the second one reaches the '.breakLock()'. 
Very improbable, but not impossible.  Then two could both be locking. 

I have no idea how to solve this. What is the equivalent of a successful mkdir, 
when successful non-existence of a directory is the criterion? While at the same 
time exactly that is the starting point for the opposite process. A riddle. 



TODO 2: Put timeout into lock dir

At the moment all processes using DLock with same name must make sure 
that they use the same TIMEOUT!  See 'lockbydir_concurrent.FastDLock'
for an elegant way to guarantee that. (Subclassing DLock)
 
New idea: Put timeout into lockdir, then each lockdir creator can decide 
about his own timeout - and all waiting consumers have to obey to that.
Would really put PATIENCE into the waiting one, and TIMEOUT into the lock.

Considerable overhead because all waiting processes will check often 
for timeout, so lots of read-access to the disk. Or all waiting loops 
get a timer each, and only come back to checking for timeout as soon
as the lock's time is up. Quite a bit of work - perhaps?
  
Still, a good idea, I guess. But as all my processes have the same timeout,
not necessary for my purposes. Fork this GIT if you want to implement it. 
(Or pay me to code it. See @bitcoin.)


And please: Contact me. Send a postcard. In any case. Thanks a lot.
This was a very interesting task! :-) Learnt a lot! Python is great!
